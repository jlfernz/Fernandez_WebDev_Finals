# Fernandez_WebDev_Finals

My COVID-19 web app is called Palit Na!. This web app is an online shopping platform for the convenience of the online sellers and buyers.
I come up with this idea because I have a lot of friends who are doing online selling because they lost their job or they want to earn more money because our situation right now is really hard. 
Also, I noticed that there are are a lot of people experiencing scams and bogus buyers.
Fake news is rampant in social media so through this web app, people can go the the right website to be updated and informed with the right information.

the webtool I used are HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap.

What I learned in this web app is that it is never easy to  create web application and to come up with an idea on how to resolve a problem immediately. It took me 2 days to think of what web app would be helpful in our situation.
I actually learned form this subject though we have limited time and we have this set up plus I always need to catch up with the lessons(because I am not a fast learner :( ), my knowledge about this field has broaden. and it helped me understand more where this course is going to take me.

I think what I need to improve is my coding skills and how I organize my thoughts because that is few of the reasons why I can't catch up immediately.
